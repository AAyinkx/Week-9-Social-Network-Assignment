## Reflection

- I am pleased that i was able to get most of the main requirements done this week despite some issues i had with my laptop
- I didn't manahge to compolete the part with the Radix component because i had some compatiblity issues with next 15 so i just left that and focussed on some other parts of the program
- Overall I am glad i got to practice my use of the docs ðŸ˜… just a bit frustrated that it made progress so slow

## What bugs did I encounter? ðŸª²

- I feel like i encountered every bug that I was able to encounter this week ðŸ˜”
- I had a lot of issues with my laptop due to some slow updates so it kept crashing unfortunately. However i managed to get it workingunday afternoon so i was able to get most of the stuff done
- The clerk docs were really useful this week even though i was referencing them every 5
- I did have a problem with the metadata where it said i couldn't export the main meta data on layout to a client page? I don't know if this is a next 15 thinng though because the metadata seemed to work okay last week
